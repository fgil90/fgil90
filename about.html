    <p>I&rsquo;m a former chemistry teacher from Brazil. I have a passion for Science, Music, Mathematics, Games and Programming.</p>
<p>Since young, I&rsquo;ve played around with web development and even worked with it for a while, but ultimately went to college to study Chemistry. After working as a teacher for 9 years, I returned to development to continue my carreer.</p>
